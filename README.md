# BestbuyBot
This program runs a bot on an item on Bestbuy website and checks if it is sold out, once the item is no longer sold out it will add it to the cart and purchase it.

If you want to use the cellphone functionality you have to set up your own twillio account and input your auth token and id into the sms.py file as well as your phone numbers otherwise just leave that code commented out.
